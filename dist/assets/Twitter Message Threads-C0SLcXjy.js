const e=`## Creative Systems: Make Twitter Easy (Threads) Research

In this UX research experiment, we're testing different experiences to help our users easily create threaded Tweets. We have two different parameters with three and two options each we are testing:

- Parameter 1: Character count to trigger actions
    - A: Fast (5 characters)
    - B: Normal (20 characters)
    - C: Slow (50 characters)

- Parameter 2: Thread trigger options
    - Y: Tooltip (Tooltip appears in lower left hand corner to suggest making a tweet into a threaded tweet)
    - Z: Accelerator (Thread is automatically created after character count is reached)

The password to access the demo is "larry".
